In this project, I worked with the "movies.csv" dataset to clean and explore the data. I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for the task.

I started by removing duplicates and fixing typos and formatting issues. Then I cleaned up unnecessary rows and columns to make the dataset more organized.

There was a 'STARS' column that included both directors and actors, so I split it into two new columns: 'Director' and 'Stars', and dropped the original one.

Finally, I did some EDA using visual tools like histograms, bar charts
